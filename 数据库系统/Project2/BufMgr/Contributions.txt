OVERVIEW: The BadgerDB project is a mini database engine that is designed for teaching database systems principles. It provides a framework for students to build parts of an data processing engine, such as a buffer manager, index organization, query operator algorithms (e.g. scan-based select, index-based select, hash join, sort merge, sort merge join, etc.).

HISTORY: BADGERDB is used at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for the undergraduate database course (CS564). It replaces the Minirel project that had been used here for over two decades. BadgerDB was first used in CS564 Spring 2012 taught by Jignesh M. Patel.
